# **Roam**

## Description

People don’t engage with their local areas as much as they used to. In our cities and towns, there are hundreds of hidden landmarks, buildings and monuments that enrich the cultural canvas of our communities.

Roam solves this problem by creating an app that promotes discovery of your local community off the beaten path. Roam’s target audience is families and young people, embedding game-like features to get everyone out and about learning new things.

Roam is a community-driven app where users create and share landmarks to educate others in the area. Roam lets users post pictures and share stories to entice others to discover the hidden gems of their community.

## Installation and Running

In your terminal enter the command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Smith0176/roam-app.git
```

Navigate your way to the directory and install all dependacies:
```
cd roam-app
npm install
```

To run the roam-app you will need to have the Expo Go app installed on your Android or IOS device.

Than in the terminal enter the command: 
```
npx expo start
```

If this doesnt work, you may need to try the following command instead and follow the promps given to you in the terminal: 

```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

You will than have a QR code logged to the terminal. Open the camera app on your device and scan this QR code. The app will compile and you should now be able to use Roam. 

Enjoy!!!
